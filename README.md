# Gotcha

A script for fetching all the counter-parties to a given ethereum address.

Relies on:

- etherscan
- metadock api

----

## TODO

- [ ] bypass metadock rate limiting by spoofing the ip. (pretty sure they are just using the ip to rate limit)
- [ ] highlight the path back to the origin address on hover. give ability to export.
- [ ] give a way to export the graph with sharable bundle (just export the graph data object to json).
- [ ] add a way to search the graph for a given address. Highlight that node
- [ ] add a way to add custom labels, with custom colors etc
